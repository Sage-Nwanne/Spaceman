I chose [Space Man](https://sage-nwanne.github.io/Spaceman/) because It seemed straight forward while also challenging my understanding of the concepts we've learned so far. I wanted to choose a game that pushed me to strengthen my logical thinking and allowed me to build upon some areas that I wasnt the most confident in.


## **Game Description**
Spaceman  is an exciting word-guessing game where players try to uncover a hidden word before they run out of attempts. With every incorrect guess, a part of the spaceman's lost signal image is revealed. If the full image is displayed, the player loses. If the player correctly guesses all the letters before using all attempts, they win!


## Rules of the Game
 ***Choose Difficulty: Players start by selecting a difficulty level:***
* Easy: Words with **1-3 difficulty level.**
* Medium: Words with **4-6 difficulty level.**
* Hard: Words with **7-10 difficulty level.**
>✅ Reveal the Word: The game selects a random word based on the chosen difficulty. The word is displayed as underscores (_), representing each letter.

> ✅ Guess a Letter: Players click on the on-screen keyboard to guess letters.

   * If the letter is in the word, it replaces the underscore in its correct position.
* If the letter is NOT in the word, it appears in the Wrong Guesses box, and a part of the image is revealed.
>✅ Limited Attempts: Players have 6 incorrect guesses before losing.

## Win/Lose Conditions:

**Win:** The player guesses all the letters before running out of attempts. 🎉
