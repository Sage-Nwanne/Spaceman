## **Game Description**
Spaceman Hangman is an exciting word-guessing game where players try to uncover a hidden word before they run out of attempts. With every incorrect guess, a part of the spaceman's lost signal image is revealed. If the full image is displayed, the player loses. If the player correctly guesses all the letters before using all attempts, they win!

🎯 Objective
